# This file is for the alx-higher_level_programming project. Here you will find the following projects

``0x00. Python - Hello, World``

In this project, I learn how to use the python interpreter, and practicing printing text and variables in python. In addition, I practiced indexing and slicing strings in Python.

``0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions``

In this project, I demonstrate conditionals and loops in Python by using if, if ... else, break, continue, pass, and range statements with while and for loops. Moreover, I practiced writing user defined (my own) Python functions while learning about scope of variables, tracebacks, and arithmetic operators.

```0x02. Python - import & modules```

In this project, I learned about importing and using functions and creating modules in Python.

```0x03-python-data_structures```

In this project, I understand and practiced the python data structures: List and tuples.

```0x0A-Python - Inheritance```

In this project, I learned about Python class inheritance

```0x0B-Python - Input/Output```

In this project, I practiced file handling in Python

```0x0C-Python - Almost a circle```

In this project, I learned skills in Python object-oriented programming by coding three connected classes to represent rectangles and squares.

```0x0D-SQL – Introduction```

In this project, we were introduced to relational databases.

```0x0E-SQL_more_queries```

Here, we execute more queries and learn about subqueries

```0x0F-python - Object_elational_mapping```

This project is about object-relational mapping and its usage for database scripting. We worked with MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy to query, create, edit, and delete tables in MySQL.

```0x04-Python-more_aata Structures```
 
In this project, I learned about sets and dictionaries in Python

```0x05. Python - Exceptions```

In this project, I learned handling errors and exceptions in Python with try and except.

```0x06. Python - Classes and Objects```

In this project, I learned about attributes, methods, and properties as well as data abstraction, data encapsulation, and information hiding.

```0x07. Python - Test-driven development```

In this project, I started practicing test-driven development using docstring and unit test in Python

```0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects```

In this project, I continued to practice object-oriented programming in Python. I learned about class methods, static methods, class vs instance attributes, andbhow to use the special __str__ and __repr__ methods.

```0x09. Python - Everything is object```

In this project, I went through object instantiation in Python, exploring variable aliasing and object identifiers, types, and mutability. The answers to the project’s quiz-like questions are found in the .txt files

```0x10-Python - Network #0```

In this networking project, we used `curl` in Bash scripts to send various types of HTTP headers.

```0x11. Python - Network #1```

What you should learn from this project:

* How to fetch internet resources with the Python package urllib
* How to decode urllib body response
* How to use the Python package requests #requestsiswaysimplerthanurllib
* How to make HTTP GET request 
* How to make HTTP POST/PUT/etc. request
* How to fetch JSON resources
* How to manipulate data from an external service

```0x12. JavaScript - Warm up```

With this project, we began to learn the concept of Javascript, the syntax and its different uses

```0x13. Javascript - Objects, Scopes and and Closures```
