# This file is for the alx-higher_level_programming project. Here you will find the following projects

``0x00. Python - Hello, World``

In this project, I learn how to use the python interpreter, and practicing printing text and variables in python. In addition, I practiced indexing and slicing strings in Python.

``0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions``

In this project, I demonstrate conditionals and loops in Python by using if, if ... else, break, continue, pass, and range statements with while and for loops. Moreover, I practiced writing user defined (my own) Python functions while learning about scope of variables, tracebacks, and arithmetic operators.
